# Breast Cancer Risk and Susceptibility Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses three different machine learning algorithms to evaluate a dataset from kaggle. The algorithms used include:
1. Logistic regression
2. Random forest
3. Decision tree

Steps carried out in the building of this project:
1. Exploratory data analysis
2. Datatase splitting (Train test set)
3. Model(s) building
4. Model(s) evaluation
5. Model(s) validation
